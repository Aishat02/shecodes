# SheCodes Portfolio

A collection of my projects and learning journey from the **SheCodes** coding workshops.

I started SheCodes to build a solid foundation in web development. Each project represents not just a technical solution. Through these workshops, I:

1. **Built practical skills** through project-based learning
2. **Developed problem-solving abilities** by tackling coding challenges
3. **Created a portfolio** of real, working applications
4. **Joined a community** of women in tech
